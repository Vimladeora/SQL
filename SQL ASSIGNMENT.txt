What is data modelling 

A Data Model in Database Management System (DBMS)  is the concept of tools that are developed to summarize the description of the database. 

 Data Models provide us with a transparent picture of data which helps us in creating an actual database

It shows us from the design of the data to its proper implementation of data.

What is E-R modeling

The Entity Relationship Model is a model for identifying entities (like student, car or company) to be represented in the database and representation of how those entities are related.

The ER data model specifies enterprise schema that represents the overall logical structure of a database graphically.

uses:-

ER diagrams represent the E-R model in a database, making them easy to convert into relations (tables).

ER diagrams serve the purpose of real-world modeling of objects which makes them intently useful.

ER diagrams require no technical knowledge of the underlying DBMS used.

It gives a standard solution for visualizing the data logically.

What is DBMS and what are its feature over filesystem

A DBMS is a system that allows users to create, modify, and query databases while ensuring data integrity, security, and efficient data access.
It organizes data into tables, views, schemas, and reports, providing a structured approach to data management.

Example:
A university database can store and manage student information, faculty records, and administrative data, allowing seamless retrieval, insertion, and deletion of information as required.


Features of DBMS:-

Data Modeling: Tools to create and modify data models, defining the structure and relationships within the database.

Data Storage and Retrieval: Efficient mechanisms for storing data and executing queries to retrieve it quickly.

Concurrency Control: Ensures multiple users can access the database simultaneously without conflicts.

Data Integrity and Security: Enforces rules to maintain accurate and secure data, including access controls and encryption.

Backup and Recovery: Protects data with regular backups and enables recovery in case of system failures.

Type of DBMS with brief on each one of them


Types of DBMS :-


 Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
______________________________________________

RDBMS organizes data into tables (relations) composed of rows and columns.

It uses primary keys to uniquely identify rows and foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.

Queries are written in SQL (Structured Query Language), which allows for efficient data manipulation and retrieval.

Examples: MySQL, Oracle.

NoSQL DBMS
__________

NoSQL systems are designed to handle large-scale data and provide high performance for scenarios where relational models might be restrictive.

They store data in various non-relational formats, such as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or columns.

These flexible data models enable rapid scaling and are well-suited for unstructured or semi-structured data.

Examples: MongoDB

Object-Oriented DBMS (OODBMS)
____________________________

OODBMS integrates object-oriented programming concepts into the database environment, allowing data to be stored as objects.

This approach supports complex data types and relationships, making it ideal for applications requiring advanced data modeling and real-world simulations.

Examples: ObjectDB, db4o.
